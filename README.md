The HyPlus LabyMod Addon is a non-official server-support-addon for the Hypixel Network. It provides a range of features to extend the game
experience and helps you to display important information directly.

Nearly all features can be toggled and customzed to fit your style and needs.

***

## Setup
1. Close all LabyMod 1.8 instances.
2. Download the [`HyPlus.jar`](https://github.com/Antimoxs/HyPlus/releases/latest) and drop it into your `.minecraft/LabyMod/addons-1.8` folder.
3. Start LabyMod 1.8.
4. Get a Hypixel-API key. 
  (Join Hypixel and do `/api`)
5. Go to the HyPlus addon settings and insert your API-key.
6. (Re)join Hypixel.

Well done! You're ready to go. :D
